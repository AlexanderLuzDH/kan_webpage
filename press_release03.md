KAN-∞: A Universal Law That Could Unlock Artificial General Intelligence

[City], [Date] – Researchers behind the breakthrough discovery of KAN-∞ (Kan-Infinity) are now pointing to its most exciting frontiers: helping machines achieve general intelligence and revolutionizing how we train large language models (LLMs).

Could KAN-∞ Solve ARC-AGI?

The ARC (Abstraction & Reasoning Corpus) is the world’s hardest benchmark for general intelligence—designed to test whether a machine can learn like a human, with just a handful of examples and no fixed rules.

KAN-∞ is a natural fit. ARC tasks are about extending small sets of examples (input–output pairs) to new unseen cases. This is exactly what KAN-∞ does: extend boundary knowledge to the whole space with guaranteed minimal complexity and maximal stability.

Instead of brute-force search or fragile pattern matching, KAN-∞ gives a principled, universal extension law that could generalize like a human—balancing precision with caution.

Early results suggest KAN-∞ could act as a general reasoning engine behind ARC, helping AI systems make logical, creative leaps without massive data.

Could KAN-∞ Train LLMs?

Today’s LLMs require:

Billions of parameters.

Weeks of GPU time.

Gigawatt-hours of energy.

KAN-∞ offers a radical alternative:

Training by Extension, not Gradient Descent.
Instead of “fitting” billions of weights, we could treat token sequences as boundary conditions and extend them across latent geometry with ∞-harmonic laws.

Fewer Examples, Faster Learning.
Because KAN-∞ generalizes from small data with mathematical guarantees, an LLM trained this way could learn new languages, styles, or domains in minutes, not weeks.

Built-in Safety & Transparency.
Every extension comes with a certificate of smoothness and bounds, making LLMs inherently more predictable, controllable, and explainable.

Efficiency Leap.
With no backpropagation and minimal energy use, KAN-∞ could make training 100× greener and cheaper, enabling responsible scale without sacrificing performance.

What This Unlocks

A Path to General AI: KAN-∞ might be the missing principle that lets AI reason across tasks it was never trained for.

Democratized AI: No billion-dollar compute budgets required—any lab, school, or small company could train models.

Safe, Certified Systems: AI that doesn’t just work, but comes with mathematical guarantees on when and where it is reliable.

Next-Gen LLMs: Imagine chatbots, translators, or copilots that can adapt instantly to new knowledge, with minimal retraining and maximal transparency.

Quotes

“ARC-AGI was designed to be impossible for black-box AI. KAN-∞ gives us a law of generalization that finally feels human-like. It could be the engine behind true AGI.”


“LLMs don’t need to be giant black boxes anymore. With KAN-∞, we can train models faster, greener, and safer—with math proving what they can and cannot do.”


Looking Forward

The research team is actively experimenting with KAN-∞ as a general reasoning core for ARC-AGI benchmarks and as a next-gen training method for language models. If successful, this could mark the beginning of a new era: efficient, transparent, and universally general AI.
