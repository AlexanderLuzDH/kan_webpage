Title: Pricing — pay only for certified outputs

Simple model
- Certified decision: charged event (meets your chosen guarantee threshold).
- Abstention: free; routed to your review queue via webhook/API.
- Guarantee knob: you choose the target (e.g., 95% or 99%). Higher target → lower coverage → lower spend, higher trust.

Indicative tiers (examples; finalize with sales)
- Starter: $0.0008 per certified decision; up to 5M certified/month; shared cloud.
- Growth: $0.0005 per certified decision; up to 50M certified/month; VPC deploy.
- Enterprise: custom per certified decision; on‑prem / air‑gapped; SLA and audit pack.

Definitions that govern billing
- Coverage: fraction of inputs that returned certified decisions at your target.
- Certified Accuracy: accuracy of certified decisions at or above your target.
- Abstention Rate: 1 − Coverage.
- SLA: if Certified Accuracy dips below your target over an agreed window, credits apply.

Add‑ons
- On‑prem SDK license, SSO/SOC2 pack, high‑availability gateway, dedicated support.
