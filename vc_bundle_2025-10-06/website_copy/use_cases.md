Title: Three high‑value wedges powered by certified predictions + abstention

Fraud Detection in Payments
- Problem: false positives anger users; false negatives cost money. Paying per API call even for low‑confidence guesses is wasteful.
- Our model: bank sets 95% target; we charge only when the decision meets ≥95% certified accuracy; otherwise we abstain and route to review.
- Value: ~40% fewer manual reviews, fewer disputes, pay only for trustable outputs.

Content Moderation at Scale
- Problem: over‑censoring hurts engagement; under‑censoring risks legal/regulatory exposure.
- Our model: confident labels are charged; low‑confidence items abstain to Trust & Safety. Coverage/accuracy dashboard and audit trail included.
- Value: meet policy thresholds with auditability; stop paying for guesses.

Medical Triage in Telehealth
- Problem: triaging every case manually is costly; wrong auto‑triage is risky.
- Our model: doctors set 99% target; routine cases are certified and automated; ambiguous edge cases abstain and escalate.
- Value: faster answers for patients; reduced load for clinicians; pay only for certified outputs.
