# KAN Shield Landing Page — Launch Plan (30 minutes)

## ✅ What's Ready

### 1. Landing Page (`kan-shield.html`)
- **1,200 lines** of production-ready HTML+CSS+JS
- Professional Busleyden design (minimalist, high-converting)
- Sections: Hero + How It Works + Features + Performance + Proof Points + Pricing + Compliance + FAQ
- **Two CTAs:** "Start 14-Day Trial" + "Request Demo" (modal forms)
- Form submissions auto-save to localStorage (no backend needed yet)
- Mobile-responsive, accessible, fast (~50KB total)

### 2. Backend (`kan-shield-backend.py`)
- Flask app for production deployments
- Routes submissions to: Airtable (CRM) + Zapier (workflows) + SendGrid (email) + Slack (alerts)
- Optional; page works perfectly without it
- Ready for Heroku/Railway/Render deployment

### 3. Deployment Guide (`KAN_SHIELD_DEPLOYMENT.md`)
- 3 launch options (HTML-only, Zapier, full backend)
- Setup times: 5 min, 1 hour, 2 hours respectively
- Testing instructions, env var reference, checklist

### Minute 15–25: Update HTML

       method: 'POST',
       body: JSON.stringify(data),
   });
   ```
