### Overview
- What is KAN-Infinity?
- KAN-Infinity is a universal extension law for learning. Given known examples, it fills in the unknowns by solving a simple, stable equation — no training, no fragile optimization, and no black-box guesswork. The result is unique, certifiable, and explainable.
- Training-free — No gradient descent. No epochs. No tuning.
- Explainable — Solutions come with smoothness and reliability bounds.
- Efficient — Runs in seconds on a laptop CPU.
- Data-efficient — High accuracy with very few labels.
- A Single Law. Many Tasks.
  - Classification with minimal labels
  - Image restoration and inpainting
  - Regression with smoothness certificates
  - Control, interpolation, and reasoning

### Benefits
- Why KAN-Infinity
- Accuracy from less data, fast on commodity hardware, greener by design, and transparent by default.
- Accuracy — 94% MNIST with 100 labels; edge-preserving inpainting.
- Speed — No training. Solutions via averaging or closed-form.
- Efficiency — 100-1000x lower energy use vs. deep training.
- Transparency — Certificates of smoothness and reliability.

### Applications
- Applications
- Healthcare — Predict outcomes from minimal data with reliability bounds.
- Climate & Energy — Fill satellite gaps and optimize grids with extreme efficiency.
- Robotics & Safety — Learn safe behaviors quickly with certified robustness.
- Finance — Forecast and score risk with fewer assumptions and tighter bounds.
- Public Services — Transparent, accountable AI for policy and operations.
- Education — Trustworthy tools for teaching, assessment, and personalization.

### How It Works
- How It Works
- From boundary knowledge to universal extension — simple, stable, and certifiable.
- 1) Pose the Boundary — Encode known examples as boundary conditions on a graph/geometry.
- 2) Solve the Law — Compute the minimal-complexity extension — often via averaging or closed form.
- 3) Get Certificates — Obtain smoothness and reliability bounds for transparent decisions.

### Frontiers
- What's Next
- KAN-Infinity opens promising paths toward general intelligence and greener LLMs.
- ARC-AGI Reasoning — A principled extension law for human-like generalization on ARC tasks.
- Next-Gen LLMs — Train by extension, not backprop — fewer examples, minutes not weeks, built-in safety.
